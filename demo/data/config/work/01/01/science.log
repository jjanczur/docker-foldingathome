This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable. GPU update with domain decomposition lacks substantial testing and should be used with caution.
Changing nstlist from 40 to 80, rlist from 1.281 to 1.322


Update task on the GPU was required, by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable, but the following condition(s) were not satisfied:

Either PME or short-ranged non-bonded interaction tasks must run on the GPU.
Compatible GPUs must have been found.
Only a CUDA build is supported.
The number of coupled constraints is higher than supported in the CUDA LINCS code.

Will use CPU version of update.
